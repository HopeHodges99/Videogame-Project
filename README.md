# Videogame-Project
My project for the game recommender 
First I load the data
Next the data is cleaned up 
For example I got rid of duplicate, null, and TBD values 
I also dropped rows with Dreamcast and Playstation Vita (both failed consoles) 
I then turned my objects and ints into floats to read and process better
I dropped everything with a meta score of 65 or lower 
All the texd has been cleaned up.
