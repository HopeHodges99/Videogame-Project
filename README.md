# Videogame-Project
My project for the game recommender. 
First I load the data.
Next the data is cleaned up. 
For example I got rid of duplicate, null, and TBD values. 
I added in filters for what console you don't want and what year and plus you want.
I then turned my objects and ints into floats to read and process better.
I dropped everything with a meta score of 65 or lower. 
I then used term frequency to make the rec system. 
The user then types in what game they want and then games simliar to that game will pop up.
